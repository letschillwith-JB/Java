Q1) Create a Java bean class Car that has following fields:

numberOfPassenger :int
numberOfKms:int

Create a class Sedan that extends Car that has following fields:
final int farePerKm =20;
Create a class HatchBack that extends Car that has following fields:
final int farePerKm =15;
Create a class OLA that has following methodspublic Car bookCar(int numberOfPassenger, int numberOfKMs)
public int calculateBill(Car car)
Implement the bookCar method in such a way that if the numberOfPassenger is less
than or equal to 3 then you should return the object of HatchBack else you should
return the object of Sedan.
Note : Set the fields of HatchBack and Sedan object appropriately.
Implement calculateBill method to calculate the total fare by usingTotal fare=numberOfKms*farePerKm
Create a Main class with main method inside this main method take the input from the
user for the number of passengers and number of kms using the Scanner class and
call bookCar method using appropriate arguments and use this returned object in the
calculate bill method to calculate the total fare.

public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
//Write logic to get numberOfPassenger and numberOfKms
Ola myOla = new Ola();
Car myCar = myOla.bookCar(numberOfPassenger, numberOfKms);
int res = myOla.calculateBill(myCar);
System.out.println("The total fare amount is"+ res);
}
